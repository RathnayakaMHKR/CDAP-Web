                    those issues.
                    It has games and activities to improve the cognitive functionalities for the Temporal lobe and
                    Frontal
                    lobe from the
                    Cerebral cortex. There are four main subcategories under them as Attention and Concentration,
                    Language,
                    Executive functions
                    and finally Memory. Each game consists of different levels. Reinforcement Learning is used in these
                    games
                    in order to predict
                    the best level for the users. All these games are designed with user friendly interfaces specially
                    for the
                    elder people and
                    in a way suitable for our culture. And the patients can view their progress with the score level as
                    well
                    as the doctor of
                    the relevant patient via a report. Implementation of the application will take over throughout the
                    year.

                  <p name="para1" id="para1" style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;">With the development
                    of the
                    countries in
                    the world, Dementia will be turned into an epidemiology due to the increase of dementia patients
                    aged 60
                    years and older
                    from 19% currently to almost 40% in year 2050. Dementia drastically affects to daily routine and
                    personal
                    activities
                    and at the same time it is often associated with behavioral symptoms, personality change and
                    numerous
                    clinical
                    complications. According to Maria Cristina Polidori, there is epidemiological evidence that
                    lifestyle
                    which is
                    engaged in leisure activities of intellectual and social nature are associated with slower cognitive
                    decline in
                    a healthy way for elderly people and it may reduce the risk of incident dementia. The performance of
                    cognitively
                    stimulating activities according to the personal interests, abilities and education of dementia
                    patients
                    are caused
                    to reduce the passive behaviors of them [1].</p>

                  <p name="para2" id="para2" style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;">When seeking for the
                    alternatives for the dementia, technology can be used to connect dementia patients and treat those
                    patients considerably individualizing the care between patient and caregiver according to their own
                    needs. Christina Yamagata, Marc Kowtko, Jean F. Coppola, Shannon Joyce focused on the mobile devices
                    as a new solution to stimulate the cognition of older adults and other patients suffering from
                    different types of dementia. And the use of brain, memory, and solving problems using different
                    types of games help to stimulate the brain and reduce the symptoms of dementia. The brain games,
                    other mobile-based and computer-based solution for the stimulation therapy has enlightened the
                    health care of dementia patients [2]. </p>
                  <h3>Reinforcement Learning</h3>
                  <p name="para3" id="para3" style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;">Reinforcement
                    Learning is learning
                    through
                    interaction with the
                    environment by taking different actions and experiencing failures and successes while trying to
                    increase
                    the receiving awards.
                    The agent is not advised which action to take. RL is different from Supervised learning, an agent
                    needs to
                    be told what the
                    correct action which is for every position it encounters. RL is different from other branches of ML
                    and it
                    is the third
                    paradigm of ML. Basically, the main components of standard model in RL are policy, reward signal,
                    value
                    function and model [3].</p>
                  <center><img src="Images/RL.png" alt="table">
                    <p style="text-align: center;">Figure 2: Interaction between agent and environment</p>
                  </center>
                  <p name="para4" id="para4" style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;">In any step, the
                    agent observes a
                    state of the environment and receives a reward signal. Based on the current state and agent’s
                    behavior function at
                    given time, which is called as policy, the agent chooses an action to take. This action is then sent
                    to the
                    environment which is updated and the loop repeats. This is how agent-environment interface works in
                    RL [4]. </p>
                  <h3>Q Learning Algorithm</h3>
                  <p name="para5" id="para5" style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;">Q-learning is a
                    reinforcement learning technique where the learner assembles steadily a Q-function which attempts to
                    measure the limited potential rewards for taking activity from given states. The output yield of
                    Q-function for the state s furthermore, activity is appeared in equation (1). Q-values are as a rule
                    hidden away investigate the table. Officially a Q-learning can be described as follows: </p>

                    <p>Initialize Q(s, a) arbitrarily </br>
                      Repeat (for each episode) </br>
                      Initialize s </br>
                      Repeat (for each step of episode): </br>
                      Choose a from s using policy derived from Q </br>
                      Take action a, observe r, s’ </br>
                      Q(s, a) = Q(s, a) + α [r+ γ maxa’ Q(s’, a’) - Q(s, a)] </br>
                      s← s’ ; </br>
                      Until s is terminal
                  </ul>
                  <p name="para6" id="para6" style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;">According to Ajay
                    Subramanian, Sharad Chitlangia, Veeky Baths model-based learning and model-free learning are
                    sub-categories of RL. In model-free methods, it updates value functions through data collection
                    directly from the environment. Model-based methods build a model of the environment which can be
                    used to generate more data by using the collected data [5]. In games, machine learning can be used
                    for different purposes. RL has its several algorithms, for example Q-learning, SARSA, DQN, and DDPG.
                    From those, Q-learning and SARSA are model-free algorithms [6]. Short-term cognitive training had
                    positive effects on reasoning and speed of processing performance well.</p>

                  <h3>Speech Recognition using Deep Learning</h3>
                  <p name="para7" id="para7" style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;">Over the previous
                    decades, a huge amount of research has been done on the use of machine learning for speech
                    processing applications, especially speech recognition. However, in the past few years, researches
                    have focused on utilizing deep learning for speech-related applications. This new area of machine
                    learning has yielded far better results when compared to others in a variety of applications
                    including speech, and thus became a very attractive area. Deep learning models can also operate as a
                    greedy layer wise unsupervised pre-training. This means that it will learn hierarchy from extracted
                    features from each layer at a time. </p>

                  <p name="para8" id="para8" style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;">DL algorithms have
                    been
                    mostly used to further
                    enhance the capabilities of computers so that it understands what humans can do, which includes
                    speech
                    recognition. The conventional
                    speech recognition systems are based on representing speech signals using Gaussian Mixture Models
                    (GMM)
                    that are based on HMM. This is since a speech signal can be considered as a piecewise stationary
                    signal or in other terms a short time stationary signal. In this short time scale, the speech signal
                    can be approximated as a stationary process, thus it can be thought of as a Markov model for many
                    stochastic processes. However, the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have shown effectiveness when
                    using in computer vision or image recognition tasks. Also, with some appropriate changes in the CNN
                    for image analysis purposes such that it incorporates speech properties, the CNN can be utilized in
                    speech recognition as well [7]. Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems convert the speech
                    signal into its corresponding text. Traditional ASR systems are based on GMM. End-to-end ASR systems
                    are gaining much popularity due to simplified model-building process and abilities to directly map
                    speech into the text without any predefined alignments. Three major types of end-to-end
                    architectures for ASR are attention-based methods, connectionist temporal classification, and
                    CNN-based direct raw speech model. End-to-end model may take raw speech signal as input and
                    generates phoneme class conditional probabilities as output [8].

                  <p name="para3" id="para3" style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;">Deep learning methods
                    are being applied in various recognition tasks for recognizing images, speech, and different kinds
                    of music. CNN especially shows remarkable recognition performance for computer vision tasks. In
                    addition, RNNs show considerable success in many sequential data processing tasks. Investigating the
                    result of the SER algorithm is based on CNNs and RNNs trained using an emotional speech database.
                    Deep learning involves hierarchical representations with increasing levels of abstraction. By
                    traversing sequentially constructed networks, the results corresponding to each selected audio frame
                    are classified using a sum of probabilities [9]. </p>
